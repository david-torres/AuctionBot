NOTICE
======

This project is dead. I started it way back when Scrolls first launched beta. I eventually got tired of keeping up with breaking changes and I wasn't playing much Scrolls anyway. Also, this code is awful as I knew (and still know) nothing about multi-threading programming. I don't recommend it as a learning resource for anyone.
